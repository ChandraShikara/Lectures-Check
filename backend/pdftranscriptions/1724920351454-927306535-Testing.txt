so we now why we need a backend in order to create a web application but which technology are you going to 
use to create a few options you could use Java review On Rails php.net Nokia 5.1 in this course the most 
important thing is allows us to create a backend using JavaScript so we can use one language spend a lot of 
extra time learning about yet another language and all of its interesting we are ready to know how to use 
JavaScript now in addition to that no it is also super fast and will allow us to create really scalable and fast 
running websites and you know the only once using node really good company here website such as trailer 
Twitter Netflix originals in the backend and more more companies are joining their ranks and starting to use 
node no in the last few years if you been to any technical conferences you had not known as a lot of people 
who are super excited about this technology and in the coming lesson you can see exactly why and how 
awesome it can be so we talk about why we want to use node but what exactly does it do anyways will 
currently in our websites we return JavaScript code and we been able to executed inside a browser now that's 
really really important but up until now that JavaScript code has been locked behind bars and kept inside the 
browser so it's only been able to interact with the browser request information from the browser when listeners 
to components in the browser but we've not been able to write JavaScript code for a website that able to go 
beyond the boundaries of the browser for example of code is unable to reach out of the browser into the user 
computer and get access to for example the file system or the networking processes and is a very good reason 
you don't want to load website parks viruses hackers who are trying to happen to your local file system it be 
very very dangerous if they could download or look into your local files right but there are some situations 
where for example if you want to build a desktop application like atom when you do need to access the file 
system in order load of those code files that the user is going to edit situations you need to be able to access the 
file system or listen to the network basically you need to be after workout that can interact directly with the 
computer independent of the browser and that's exactly what node JS allows us to do it allows us to take 
JavaScript out of the browser and liberate it allowing it interact directly with the hardware of a computer so we 
can now use JavaScript inside a website in order to give it functionality and behaviour for implementing 
animations or drop down menu use but no JS allows us to use JavaScript to interact directly with the hardware 
the computer so we can use it for example to create a desktop application and in fact atom the code editor that 
we will using all of this time is based on node JS so now with node JS you can write JavaScript code not just in 
the browser to affect the behaviour of your website applications that work on your computer right so some of 
you guys might think well fair enough so you can use no just to program desktop applications why is that 
interesting to me we are learning how to make websites right well we can run node JS on our own computer 
but we could also use to run JavaScript code on somebody else's computer login to Google I am putting a 
query and your browser will make a request to Google Service and on the service we can actually execute 
JavaScript code to process the request and after that time we can send back the result to the user to the client 
and simply get their web browser to display the information and all of the heavy lifting the code execution 
happens behind the scenes on the server on the client side and now make your website a lot more capable so in 
the coming lessons we can be using node JS to interact directly with the computer in order to access local files 
or listen to network traffic and manipulate databases so I have you looking forward to it in the next lesson we 
can get started installing node so make sure you check the lesson title for the correct lesson I used to follow 
because one of them is for PC uses and another one of once you done with the installation will get back on the 
coding and creating websites and seeing what you can do with this fantastic Technology
